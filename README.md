## About
The Revit Schedule CSV Parser is a Revit utility that performs a batch extraction to CSV of all Revit schedules from all Revit files in a folder and subfolders. It was developed by Donovan Wilson and Randall Stevens of [AVAIL](https://www.getavail.com/About) as part of the Building Content Summit presentation "Identifying Data Patterns from Professional Practice" by Van Woods. With the permissive MIT open source license from AVAIL, derivatives, enhancments, fixes, documentation, and participation in the submission of crowd sourced data for industry-wide analysis is encouraged.
